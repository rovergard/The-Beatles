The book he's written is based on a novel by a man named Lear and it took him years to complete. The author is desperate for someone, perhaps a publisher, to read his book, and he's hopeful that it'll be liked enough to secure him the rights, potentially making a fortune. However, he's also prepared for rejection, indicating that a returned book can be sent back. The story also includes elements of a sordid tale involving a misunderstood man, his ignorant wife, and a son who has a job at the Daily Mail but shares his father's dream of becoming a paperback writer. In all, the song details the struggle, hope, and aspiration of a would-be novelist."

There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back  In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
